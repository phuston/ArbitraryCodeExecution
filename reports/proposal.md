## Exploits in C Project Proposal
Kai Levy and Patrick Huston | Software Systems Spring 2018
### Goal

In this project, we hope to explore the common methods of software exploitation in C. In specific, we want to understand the basis of how it works, what makes software vulnerable, and the steps that can be taken to ensure safety from a developer standpoint. 

### Learning Goals

  - Learn about real security vulnerabilities that can occur in common programs, how to exploit them, and how to avoid them. 
  - Research and learn about vulnerabilities to real software - understanding what the issue was, how it was exploited, and how it was fixed.
  - Develop simple and effective C programs

### Resources Needed
Tutorials on writing exploits in C:

http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html
We would additionally be interested in further resources recommended by a professor.

### First Steps

1. Find further resources on overflow exploits and arbitrary code execution in C. 
    - This will be done by all team members independently. 
    - Once we have compiled a list, we will meet to decide on a good one to get started with. 
2. Follow through a tutorial on code exploits in C to develop a solid fundamental understanding on how such bugs occur, can be exploited, and can be patched. 
    - This will be done by all team members together, in pair programming sessions.
    - This will be considered done when we have completed one (or more) tutorials and feel confident in our ability to write similar exploits in C.
3. Develop our own simple program that can be exploited through a vulnerability that we learned about, and develop a patched version.
    - This will be done by all team members together, in pair programming sessions
    - Completion criteria: we have developed a handful (2-4) of simple programs and patches that highlight different vulnerabilities, or different flavors of similar vulnerabilities
